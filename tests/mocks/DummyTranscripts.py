    (1, "That's clear. For the picture upload, will we need any cropping or resizing functionality on the client side?"),

    (0, "The images should be stored in our S3 bucket, and the path to the image will be saved in the user's database record."),

    (1, "Okay, so we have two main components: the private 'Edit Profile' form and the 'Public Profile' view."),

    (0, "Yes, a single endpoint to update all the profile data at once would be efficient."),
    (1, "It would. The endpoint should be authenticated, ensuring users can only edit their own profile."),
    (0, "Of course, standard user authentication and authorization rules apply."),

    (0, "Yes, all the new fields should be optional. Users don't have to fill them out if they don't want to."),

    (0, "Management is hoping to get this into the next sprint, which starts on Monday."),
    (1, "That's an aggressive timeline, but it seems achievable if we stay focused."),
    (0, "What's your initial estimate on the effort required?"),
    (1, "Roughly, I'd say the backend work is about 3 story points, and the frontend is probably 5 points."),
    (0, "So, 8 points in total. That fits within our sprint capacity."),
    (1, "Yes, I think so. I'll start drafting the technical specification for the API and the database migration today."),

# Transcript with some moderate issues, should yield a mid-level quality score
# Mistakes include:
#   - Meaning-Altering Transcription Errors: Words are replaced with phonetically similar ones that make the sentence nonsensical (e.g., "Eagle Beak," "great flue," "railhead").
#   - Crosstalk/Jumbled Speech: A section where speakers talk over each other, and the transcription is a confusing mess of their words.
#   - Missing Information: Use of [inaudible] for a key piece of information.
#   - Significant Speaker Misidentification: A block of dialogue is attributed to the wrong speaker, creating confusion about who is agreeing to what.

# Transcript with many issues, should yield a low quality score
# Mistakes include:
#  - Severe & Pervasive Transcription Errors: Most lines contain nonsensical or meaning-altering words (e.g., "fountain" for "mountains", "dike" for "hike", "real dread" for "trailhead").
#  - Critical Inaudible Sections: Key information, like locations or times, is missing and marked [inaudible].
#  - Chaotic Speaker Misidentification: Speaker attribution is so jumbled that the conversation becomes contradictory and nonsensical.
#  - Incoherent Crosstalk: Sentences are mashed together into unreadable fragments.
#  - Complete Breakdown of Conversation: The speakers eventually get confused by the poor quality and cannot reach a conclusion.
