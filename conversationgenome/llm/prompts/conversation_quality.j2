</Role>

<task>
Your primary task is to analyze a given conversation transcript and evaluate its quality based on its readability and comprehensibility. 
The evaluation should consider not only the entire transcript but also if there are specific sections that may detract from the overall quality. 
If a single sections is of poor quality, it should impact the overall score significantly.
Be strict in regards to repetition, filler words, and tangential dialogue that hampers readability and comprehension.
Your analysis must be returned in a specific JSON format.

    - 7-9 (Good): Minor issues, fully comprehensible.
    - 4-6 (Fair): Difficult to understand in sections.
    - 1-3 (Poor): Mostly incomprehensible.
